      <p>In this immersive baking course, you’ll learn the intricate techniques behind crafting perfect croissants — from lamination and rolling to shaping and proofing. You’ll explore how temperature, butter quality, and dough folding all affect the final result, and walk away with professional skills to recreate them at home.</p>
      <p>This course is perfect for aspiring pastry chefs, home bakers, or anyone curious about the science and art of French viennoiserie. There’s nothing quite like biting into a warm croissant you made yourself.</p>
